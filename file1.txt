The recently approved Academic Blueprint adds new academic programs to the campus and guides planning for physical and curricular support for those programs. The additional programs will enhance the campus service to the region and provide new options and opportunities for students. Criminology and justice studies starts in fall 2003. We are also preparing for four new majors in fall 2004 - physical education and kinesiology, mass media, biochemistry, a masters in middle-level education and a doctorate in educational administration (in cooperation with SDSU and UCSD).
